# Privacy Policy for EPUB Manager (dala)

**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how the **EPUB Manager (dala)** browser extension collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any external servers.**

The extension functions strictly as a **local bridge** between your browser and a Python script running on your own computer (`localhost`).

### Types of Data Handled:
-   **URLs and Content:** When you click "Download Page" or "Download Bundle," the extension sends the URL and HTML content of the active tab to your local server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
-   **Cookies:** If you enable the "Include Cookies" option, the extension accesses cookies *only* for the specific site you are downloading. These cookies are sent *only* to your local server to allow it to fetch content you have access to (e.g., paywalled articles, forum attachments).
-   **Authentication:** We do not track, store, or view your passwords or login credentials.

## 2. Data Storage

-   **Extension Storage:** The extension uses your browser's local storage (`browser.storage.local`) to save your **preferences** (e.g., "No Images", "Download Folder") and the **current download queue**. This data never leaves your browser.
-   **Generated Files:** The EPUB files generated by the local server are saved to your computer's temporary directory or the specific download folder you configure.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This extension does **not** use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## 4. Communications

The extension communicates **exclusively** with:
1.  **Your Local Machine:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (The Python backend).
2.  **The Websites You Visit:** To fetch images or content required for the EPUB generation (only when initiated by you).

## 5. Contact Us

If you have questions about this policy, please contact the developer via the GitHub repository issue tracker.
